  description: |
    This project is a calculation programm to model quantum properties of light propagation
    along an array of single mode waveguides with cubic nonliniarity. Calculation is performed 
    in assumption of that quantum state of light is gaussian. This allows to write a
    closed system of ordinary differential equations based on Heizenberg approach.
    The numeric solution of the given system of equetions is performed here by using 4th order
    Rungeâ€“Kutta method.

  #parameters are double, named numbers which influence on result of calculation
  #parameters are defined as a list of maps with two fields: name , description

properties:
  #properties are values which influence the calculation process but not the result 
  #(except some accuracy issues)
  #ccs introduce two default properties: output_path, and tmp_path
  #output_path - the destination, where to put the result .nc file
  #tmp_path - folder where could be placed some tmp files. ccs will check for this folder and delete it after the work finished (with success or failure)
  #you should not redefine this properties
  #Here should go the list of items, each of which describes single property
  - name: cuda_device
    optional: false # a boolean property which shows if this property is required for calculation. Default: false 
    list: false #flag to show that if need to set a list of properties here. Default: false
    type: int #shows the type of the property: currently we support only int, string, float, boolean  
outputs:
  #a list of outputs which calculator will generate. Should be defined as a list of items
